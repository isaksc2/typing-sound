# typing-sound
Plays sounds when typing. 

The sound can be activated or deactivated by typing "enable sound" or "disable sound".

The volume of the sounds have been equalized using a formula described in  "calculateParameters.ipynb", meaning that the volume is always the same, regardless of the windows volume.
